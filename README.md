# house-market-price-prediction
This is a simple method of predicting house prices using Gradient descent algorithm..
Prices are predicted based on  the following Variables.
1. size per square feet
2. number of rooms

I also make a comparison between the predictions obtained using gradient descent and the predictions obtained form the Normal Equation (i.e inv(phi'*phi)*(phi'Y))
